Takes data from EMG (dataset on Kaggle) and classifies the signals into if the patient was doing the rock, paper, or scissors sign with their hands using a supervised Support Vector Classifier Machine Learning Model
I also added a little game in which you can input the EMG data, it will classify it into either rock, paper or scissors, and you play against a computer random generating a move.
With given resources I could make it so that EMG data is sent in real time and a patient who cannot move or is paralyzed can play rock paper scissors.
With more EMG data representing different motions or signals, we can use brain signals as such to do more complex and necessary things like saying words or picking and placing items (potentially connected to a robotic arm)
